{"name":"String Plugin for Xcode","tagline":"Improved string editing, especially for escapes","body":"# HOStringSense for Xcode [![Flattr this git repo](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=holtwick&url=https://github.com/holtwick/HOStringSense-for-Xcode&title=HOStringSense-for-Xcode&language=&tags=github&category=software) \r\n\r\nPerfect for editing regular expressions, multi line texts, inline HTML and many more use cases.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nEdit strings like `@\"Hello\\nWorld!\"` unescaped!\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/holtwick/HOStringSense-for-Xcode/raw/master/Xcode.png \"Example\")\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nSimply build the Xcode project and restart Xcode. The plugin will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. First remove the plugin from there (and restart Xcode).\r\n\r\nIf you get a \"Permission Denied\" error while building, please see [this issue](https://github.com/omz/ColorSense-for-Xcode/issues/1).\r\n\r\n## Keyboard Shortcut\r\n\r\nWith a little trick you can enable keyboard shortcut for showing the popover. Open `System Preferences` app, then section `Keyboard` and add a custom application shortcut for Xcode as in the following image:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](https://github.com/holtwick/HOStringSense-for-Xcode/raw/master/Shortcut.png \"Keyboard Shortcur\")\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\nI'm a Mac and iOS developer, follow me on Twitter [@holtwick](https://twitter.com/holtwick) or ADN [@ho](https://alpha.app.net/ho).\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThis work is derived from the awesome [Color Sense](https://github.com/omz/ColorSense-for-Xcode) plugin of Ole Zorn.
