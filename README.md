## Installation

Simply build the Xcode project and restart Xcode. The plugin will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. First remove the plugin from there (and restart Xcode).

If you get a "Permission Denied" error while building, please see [this issue](https://github.com/omz/ColorSense-for-Xcode/issues/1).
